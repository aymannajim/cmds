# cmds
some useful FiveM ESX commands for Roleplay

**These are mainly some useful RP commands for ESX final:**
>**`/h`** → Hands up
>**`/k`** →   Kneel as if you're being arrested
>**`/job`** → Shows your actual job
>**`/ping`** →  Shows your actual ping
>**`/cash`** →  Shows your current cash
>**`/license`** →  Copies your license ( identifier ) to clipboard - very useful for admins to ask for in order to run sql queries to find smth about a player

**Some bonus stuff:**
> * **Warns** you when your ping is high ( > 150 ms )
> * **Makes** helicopters very hard to fly
> * **Makes** planes impossible to fly ( Engine cuts off mid-air after seconds )
>
>( the latter two features are to prevent players from riding/stealing aircrafts so you need to implement your own license system in order to make other players with license able of flying them - you can comment lines from **32 to 46** and **50 to 59** if you don't want this )

**Installation:**
>Throw it in your resources folder and add this in your server.cfg:
**`start cmds`**
